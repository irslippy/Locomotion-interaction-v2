# Locomotion-interaction-v2

# I chose to use continuous locomotion and smooth turning because it is more immersive and natural than teleportation and snap turning. On top of this, I wanted to use these means of locomotion because I also wanted to implement them in my final project. I figured it would be best to learn this method first so I had the most experience with it.


# I also chose to use the button interaction as well as physical hands (which was a struggle at first) because i find it to be more immersive as well. I want to reuse many of these ideas when I make my final project.
